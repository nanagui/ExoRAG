# Accelerating Exoplanet Validation with Physics-Informed AI: Proposal for NASA Space Apps 2025

## Abstract
The NASA Space Apps 2025 challenge "A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI" calls for solutions that can sift through the vast stream of transit photometry to accelerate the confirmation of new worlds. We propose a hybrid architecture that fuses convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based deep learning with physics-informed constraints and retrieval-augmented scientific context. The system processes Kepler, TESS, and K2 light curves in real time, achieves a projected F1-score above 0.98 with 60% fewer labeled samples through synthetic augmentation, and delivers explainable predictions in under 100 milliseconds. This paper consolidates the theoretical foundations, system design, and implementation plan for the solution. Empirical validation and benchmarking will be documented after software development.

## 1. Introduction
Photometric surveys such as NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) uncover thousands of candidate signals each year. From the 7,655 candidates flagged by TESS to date, only 638 have been confirmed, primarily due to the manual effort required to vet transit-like signatures. The resulting validation bottleneck delays the characterization of potentially habitable worlds and limits citizen-science participation. Artificial intelligence can reduce this bottleneck by automating the detection of planetary transits while respecting astrophysical constraints. This paper details the conceptual design of an end-to-end AI system to be developed during the NASA Space Apps 2025 hackathon. The scope includes theoretical underpinnings, architecture, and planned evaluation; experimental results are left for future work.

## 2. Related Work
State-of-the-art exoplanet classifiers often combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent layers to capture both morphological and temporal patterns in light curves. The NASA ExoMiner project leverages a CNN-based approach to achieve precision near 99% on Kepler data (Valizadegan et al., 2021). Subsequent studies (e.g., Jenkins et al., 2024) showed that BiLSTM enhancements improve recall on noisy TESS observations. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) introduced by Raissi et al. (2019) have recently been adapted to astrophysical modeling but are rarely incorporated into classification pipelines. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a tool for contextual verification in scientific workflows, yet it remains underexplored in exoplanet validation. Our proposal extends the hybrid CNN-BiLSTM paradigm with attention-based interpretability, physics-informed loss components capturing Keplerian transit constraints, and an embedded RAG assistant that cross-references predictions with NASA archives and peer-reviewed literature.

## 3. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Transit Photometry Fundamentals
Transit detection relies on measuring periodic dips in stellar brightness as a planet crosses its host star. The transit depth approximates $(R_p/R_s)^2$, where $R_p$ and $R_s$ are planetary and stellar radii. Transit duration and period must be dynamically consistent with Kepler's laws for a physically plausible orbit. Instrumental noise, stellar variability, and eclipsing binaries introduce confounding signals that necessitate sophisticated filtering.

### 3.2 Deep Learning for Time-Series Classification
CNNs capture local transit morphology such as ingress and egress slopes, while Bi-directional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) preserve long-range context across multiple orbital periods. Attention mechanisms improve interpretability by highlighting time steps that contribute most to the classification decision, aiding astronomers in manual validation. Class imbalance is a primary challenge because confirmed planets represent a minute fraction of labeled events; techniques such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and physically realistic signal injection mitigate this imbalance.

### 3.3 Physics-Informed Neural Networks
PINNs encode known physical laws into the training objective. By penalizing deviations from expected transit depth, duration, and orbital dynamics, the classifier is encouraged to reject artifacts that violate Keplerian mechanics. The proposed loss function integrates a constraint term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$ that compares predicted transit parameters against analytical solutions derived from stellar mass and radius estimates.

### 3.4 Retrieval-Augmented Scientific Validation
A RAG pipeline grounds model outputs in domain knowledge. Light curve embeddings generated by BGE-M3 encode both numerical descriptors and textual metadata. A Qdrant vector index retrieves similar confirmed transits from NASA archives with millisecond latency. Retrieved documents feed a large language model agent that produces justifications, references, and anomaly alerts, positioning the AI as a co-pilot rather than a black box.

## 4. Data Resources and Preprocessing
We will leverage publicly available datasets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, specifically Kepler DR25, K2, and TESS sectors relevant to short-period transits. Light curves will be processed using the Lightkurve library: detrending via `lc.flatten(window_length=401).remove_outliers(sigma=5).remove_nans()`, phase-folding, and normalization (RobustScaler). A 74/26 synthetic-to-real ratio will be achieved by injecting simulated transits generated with PyTransit or BATMAN into noise profiles that mimic TESS variability. SMOTE will address residual class imbalance in the feature space. Quality checks ensure mean-zero, unit-variance flux and absence of NaNs before training.

## 5. Proposed Architecture

### 5.1 Multi-Path Neural Backbone
The classifier consists of three concurrent pathways: (i) a CNN branch extracting local morphological features, (ii) a BiLSTM branch capturing temporal dependencies, and (iii) a self-attention head aligning informative windows. Outputs are concatenated and fed into fully connected layers. The final layer predicts a posterior probability of planetary transit.

### 5.2 Physics-Informed Loss Integration
Transit parameter estimates derived from attention-weighted embeddings are passed to a physics module that computes residuals against analytic expectations. The composite loss is $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}} + \lambda\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}$, with cross-validation used to tune $\lambda$. This reduces dependency on large labeled datasets while improving physical consistency.

### 5.3 Retrieval-Augmented Validation Layer
Post-prediction, the system triggers a RAG workflow: the predicted planet candidate, its period, and attention heatmap indices are embedded and queried against the Qdrant store populated with NASA publications and confirmed planetary systems. A lightweight large language model (LLM) summarizes supporting evidence, flags potential stellar variability, and produces citations, enabling transparent human review.

### 5.4 Deployment and User Experience
A FastAPI backend orchestrates inference, RAG queries, and data management. GPU acceleration (NVIDIA RTX-class) affords sub-100 ms inference per light curve. The React dashboard visualizes raw and cleaned curves, attention overlays, and retrieved references. Citizen scientists can upload light curves, review AI explanations, and escalate promising candidates to professional astronomers.

## 6. Implementation Plan
The 48-hour hackathon will follow staged milestones:
- **0–16 hours (Must Have):** Implement baseline CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model with PyTorch; establish Lightkurve preprocessing pipeline; apply SMOTE; validate on a held-out subset of TESS data using stratified k-fold cross-validation.
- **16–32 hours (Should Have):** Integrate synthetic transit generation, physics-informed loss, Qdrant-based RAG, and cross-mission ensembling. Deploy inference services via FastAPI.
- **32–40 hours (Could Have):** Build interactive attention visualization (React/Three.js), enable near real-time TESS stream ingestion, incorporate uncertainty quantification, and prototype binary-star deconvolution.
- **Pre-hackathon preparation:** Assemble Docker images with CUDA support, pre-download datasets, and pre-compute embeddings for NASA literature to accelerate hackathon execution.
Team members will work in parallel across data engineering, model development, and interface delivery, synchronized via shared notebooks and CI pipelines.

## 7. Risk Management
Key risks include severe class imbalance causing zero recall, preprocessing failures on high-noise TESS sectors, and time overruns due to architectural complexity. Mitigations involve enforcing SMOTE before training, validating preprocessing metrics (flux mean, standard deviation, NaN counts), staging model complexity increments, and maintaining a Random Forest baseline for emergency fallback.

## 8. Evaluation Strategy
Planned quantitative metrics are F1-score, precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, and inference latency (<100 ms). Cross-mission validation will assess generalization by training on Kepler and testing on TESS/K2 subsets. Qualitative evaluation will involve astronomers reviewing attention maps and RAG justifications. Future iterations will include ablation studies isolating the impact of physics-informed loss and RAG assistance.

## 9. Expected Impact and Future Work
By enforcing physical plausibility and contextual transparency, the proposed system aspires to reduce validation times from weeks to milliseconds while preserving scientific rigor. The architecture democratizes discovery by inviting citizen scientists to collaborate through an accessible interface. Future extensions include integrating James Webb Space Telescope infrared data, implementing Bayesian uncertainty estimates, and deploying lightweight models for edge and mobile observatories.

## 10. Conclusion
This paper presents the theoretical blueprint for a physics-informed, RAG-enabled AI pipeline targeting the NASA Space Apps 2025 challenge. It synthesizes current research, describes an end-to-end architecture, and outlines the implementation roadmap and evaluation protocols. The forthcoming development phase will realize the system and deliver empirical results, which will be documented in a subsequent publication.
